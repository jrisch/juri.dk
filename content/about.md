Hi. Here's a few words about myself.

I'm a long time partner and CTO in Fab:IT ApS, an IT consultancy and hosting
company in Copenhagen, Denmark, that focuses on Open Source solutions. My main
responsibilities is automating processes as much as possible (installation and
configuration), documenting procedures and processes, and ensuring that we use
the best technology in our solutions, through research and pitching for the rest
of my team.

I'm also the owner of a webshop company called Optimal Minimal, where I sell
various health-related products. Since recovering from a long, hard period of
stress I finally changed my lifestyle, and Optimal Minimal got started because
of that. I hope that I can share some of the knowledge I got from the recovery,
with others, through Optimal Minimal.

In 2012 I got my first motorcycle. I've pondered over getting one 3 to 4 years
prior to that, but always convinced myself that it wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
But since I made up my mind and got one, I haven't looked back. It was one of
the best decisions I've made; I've got a couple of new friends that I ride with,
I got to ride with my son on the back of my bike, and we have taken some nice
trips. I've ridden the Distinguished Gentlemans Ride 3 times in a row, and taken
shorter trips with my riding buddies. But it's when I'm riding alone I find it
most therapeutic for me - it clears my mind and makes me feel alive and free.
