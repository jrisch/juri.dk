Photography has been one of my favorite hobbies, since I got my first camera, an
Olympus OM101, back in 1986. At first I cherished every single picture, waited
for the right subject to appear and made sure to get in the right position both
in terms of distance and angle, as I only had 24 or 36 images per roll of film.
Later on, it was just a matter of bringing enough film rolls.

I primarily took color pictures and had them developed at the photo store. But
when I got interested in black & white photography, I wanted to try to develop
them myself. That took place at my parents house, with equipment bought used.

When my son was born, I was gifted with a compact digital camera to take pictures
of him, but when that died quickly, I acquired a DSLR camera, a Canon EOS 10D.
It was an expired model I got on a sale with a kit zoom lens. The change to a
DSLR really got me hooked on photography again, and I took a lot of pictures with
it.

I got interested in experimenting with long exposures and HDR after a couple of
years with the 10D, but I found that it was limiting me. So I bought a Canon 60D
that gave me a faster camera, HD video, slowmotion video and much more. Furthermore
I bought a fixed 50mm lens. This is still my current photography setup.
